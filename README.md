# SpeedrunTimingTool
Timing Tool for mouse droid skip on JK2
Must be run as administrator to allow for the capture of inputs while in game.

Includes 3 timing bars, with highligted zones which must be configured manually for your specific setup.

The first bar triggers on RELEASE of crouch(C) and stops on the press of pause(ESC), which also starts the second bar. The second bar ends on the second press of pause(ESC), and starts the third bar, which stops on the PRESS of the use key (E).

By default this is setup to use C, ESC, and E as the three button sequence. Those hotkeys and the timings for the highligted zones can be configured.
